# Launch copy

Post text for the banners in `banners/`. Written in the site's voice: plain,
exact, no hype. Every claim here is about the mechanism, not about results —
see **Before you post** at the bottom, which is not optional.

## Profile

**Name** — `Nekara`

**Bio.** The header already carries the statement, so the bio should not
repeat it. Its job is the mechanism — why the claim is checkable.

Recommended (155 / 160):

> An automated screener on Robinhood Chain. Every call is hashed into an
> append-only register — the misses stay up because the schema refuses to
> delete them.

Shorter (132), if you want the launchpad named:

> Automated signals on Robinhood Chain, Pons launches included. Every call
> hashed into an append-only register, so the misses cannot come down.

Sharpest (125), once the account has calls to back it:

> Wins, misses and the ones that died, on the same page, under the same rules.
> Removing any of them breaks every hash after it.

## The thread

Seven posts. Post 1 stands alone if you'd rather open quietly and run the rest
later; 2 through 7 read in order.

### 1 · `p0-intro.png`

*Short (269):* Nekara — a public register of automated trading signals. A
screener reads liquidity, buy pressure and volume acceleration across four
chains. Every signal is published with the conditions that fired it, then
tracked to win, miss or dead. Failed calls are never removed.

*Alt:* The Nekara mark and wordmark over the register page, dimmed back.

### 2 · `p5-scan.png`

*Alt:* A panel headed "Last 24 hours" listing candidates scanned, killed at the
gates, cleared but scored low, signals fired, and the pass rate.

### 3 · `p1-triage.png`

> Every rejection is published with the gate that killed it.

*Alt:* A list of rejected candidates, each with the reason it was rejected and
a tag for the gate that killed it.

### 4 · `p4-gates.png`

> Eight hard vetoes run before anything is scored.
>
> Liquidity floor. Age window. Cap window. Liquidity-to-cap. Sell pressure.
> Entry angle. Identity. Quote asset.
>
> Any single failure kills a signal no matter how good the rest looks. The

*Alt:* A panel headed "Active gates" listing each veto with its threshold.

### 5 · `p3-hindsight.png`

> Peak × is a ceiling nobody sold at.

*Alt:* An equity curve under a set of exit rules, with the resulting return,
profitable calls and worst drawdown beneath it.

*Alt:* The chain head, and a tamper check reporting that a call was removed at
sequence 3 and the published anchor no longer matches what is stored.

### 7 · `b3-method.png`

> A win and a call that died sit on the same page, under the same rules, both

*Alt:* Two call cards side by side — one marked WIN, one marked DEAD — each
showing its score, the conditions that fired it, and its entry, peak and
current market cap.

## The alpha channel

For `a1-alpha.png` (X) and `a2-alpha-square.png` (Telegram, Instagram).

**What this copy may not say.** Not "first", not "early", not "ahead of the
public channel". The alpha channel rides `delays[0]` exactly like the public
leg — a Telegram channel cannot ask who is reading it, so posting to one early
would hand everybody with the invite link a head start over every key holder
who paid for seconds. What separates it is *what goes in it*, never *when*.
Nor may it name the channel or paste an invite: the links are single-use,
fifteen-minute and issued per wallet, and a link in a post is a seat given to
whoever scrolls fastest.

### The post

> Three keys opens a second channel.
>
> Not earlier — the alpha channel posts on the same clock as the public one.
> Only the highest-scoring calls go in it.
>
> The invite is issued to the wallet that holds the keys, and taken back when
> they go.
>
> nekara.xyz/alpha

189 characters. The second line is the one doing the work: saying plainly that
this is not a head start is the claim nobody else on that timeline can make,
and it is the only reason to believe the rest of the account.

### The reply, if someone asks how

> Connect the wallet on nekara.xyz/alpha, send /link to @nekaraxbot, paste the
> code. If the wallet holds three keys the bot hands you the link the moment it
> is linked. `/alpha` asks again any time.

## The mint

For `x4-mint-live.png` (X) and `x4-mint-live-square.png` (Telegram, Instagram).

**Three things must be true on chain before any of this is posted**, and none of
them is checked by the banner — `MINT_STATE` is an env var, not a chain read:

1. **`PUBLIC_DELAY_S` is no longer 0.** A key buys latency. While the public leg
   is 0s the free channel gets the call at the same instant as Tier III, so a
   key buys nothing at all — and the first sale would be latency sold and not
   delivered. It is set to 0 only while nothing has been sold; the phase opening
   is the moment that stops being true.
2. **The renderer on chain is the current one.** `parity.js` found the deployed
   art a deploy behind the page — Ashfall drew six bright dots on chain against
   a drift of twenty-six, the spoke crown a dashed circle. A buyer receiving
   different art from what was displayed is mis-selling, not a rough edge.
   `node contracts/keys.js renderer --confirm` first.
3. **The seed is committed.** `mintPublic` does not require a commitment, and
   `recommitSeed` is already gone — it only works while `totalMinted == 0` and
   keys exist. So if `seedCommit` is still zero this is a one-shot with no undo,
   and it belongs *before* the paid phase: a commitment made after minting has
   begun is made by a deployer who already knows part of the entropy.

`node contracts/keys.js state` answers all three, plus whether the phase is
actually One. A banner that says LIVE NOW next to a contract that reverts is
the one thing this product exists not to do.

**What this copy may not say.** Nothing about returns, revenue, a share of
anything, or the token. A key buys seconds on a feed and a filter above three
keys, and that is the whole of it. "Access, not an investment" is on the banner
because it is the claim the account has to be able to defend on its worst day.

### Two posts, on the owner's instruction

**1 — the announcement**, banner attached. 247 characters.

> Proof Keys, Season 1 — phase 1 is open. 666 keys at $2, max 5 a wallet.
>
> A key buys latency: the same call everyone gets, further up the queue. The
> tier is drawn from a seed nobody could grind, on published odds — 9.91 /
> 30.03 / 60.06.
>
> nekara.xyz/mint

Odds and not counts, because fixed counts would need a shuffle and the two
claims contradict each other.

**2 — the reply.** 240 characters, and it carries two jobs because there is no
third post: the address a buyer pastes, and the sentence nobody else on that
timeline writes.

> Contract: `0xe0b0EBDbfAD58d803B4AB654e9508aa6803550Ec` — Robinhood Chain, 4663.
>
> A key does not buy revenue, a share of anything, or a promise about returns.
> It buys seconds on a feed, and a filter above three keys. Access, not an
> investment.

Post it yourself rather than waiting to be asked. The same words are an answer
when you write them first and a defence when somebody else does.

## The token

For `x5-token.png` (X) and `x5-token-square.png` (Telegram, Instagram).

**What this copy may not say.** Nothing in the code gives `$NEKARA` a function.
Latency is bought with a key — `bestTierOf` reads ProofKeys and `tgbot.js` asks
it on every send — and the token is not in that path anywhere. So the token is
the register's token and that is all it is until something in the repository
says otherwise. Copy that implies it buys the feed, the tier or the early leg
is the first false thing on the account, on the one product that exists as an
argument against exactly that.

### The post

One post, the wide banner attached, the address in it. 270 characters with a
real 42-character address — inside X's 280 with ten to spare, so nothing here
can be trimmed without checking the count again.

> $NEKARA is live.
>
> The token of a register that publishes every call with the conditions that
> fired it — and cannot delete the ones that fail. The schema refuses updates
> and deletes outright.
>
> CA: `0x…`
> nekara.xyz · t.me/nekaraxyz

The placeholder is `0x…` and not a plausible-looking string of zeroes on
purpose: pasted by accident it is obviously unfinished, where `0x0000…0000`
is a real address someone can send to.

The address goes in the post rather than on the banner because a post can be
deleted and reposted in the first minute and a banner cannot be corrected once
it is on a timeline.

## Before you post

**The numbers in the scoreboard banners are mock data.** They come from the
design prototype's seed — 412 scanned, 12 fired, 2.42×, −93.2% — and `CALLS` in
`mkbanners.js` has to be edited and the banner re-rendered before either
scoreboard goes anywhere.

**The engine has fired real calls, and that is still not a track record.** It
runs live on Robinhood Chain and the register holds calls it found itself. What
it does not hold is enough settled ones for a hit rate, a median or a best peak
to mean anything, and `/api/analytics/bands` wants about a hundred before it is
worth reading. So the copy stays where it is: about how the register works,
never about how it has done. The first number posted as performance is the
first false thing on the account.
Presenting those figures as performance would be the first false thing on the
account, and this whole product is an argument against exactly that.

**No domain or contract address is written into any of this.** Add the link
wherever you want it — a reply on post 1 is the usual place. The contract is
not out yet, so do not imply otherwise.

**The mint page is honest now, and it has to stay that way.** It reads
"Mint not open", "0 / 666 minted", "Contract: not deployed", and all three
phases "Not open" — because that is the chain's answer. `MINT_STATE` moves the
banners when a phase opens; check `node contracts/keys.js state` before you
move it. A banner that says mint now, next to a contract that reverts, is the
one thing this product exists not to do.
