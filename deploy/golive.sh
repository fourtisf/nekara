cat <<'NOTES'

== what happens now ==
The engine polls every 60s for candidates and every 20s to re-mark live calls.
The site holds a websocket to /feed, so a signal lands on the page the moment
its tier's timer fires, and falls back to a 20s poll if the socket drops. There
is nothing else to do.

The header says which of those is true — "live" for the socket, "polling" for
the fallback, "engine offline" when neither answers. If it says offline while
this script reported the API answering, the nginx include is the thing to look
at, not the engine.

Public readers are PUBLIC_DELAY_S behind the desk, an hour by default. With no
keys minted that hour is a delay nobody has paid to skip, and the public page
shows nothing until it passes. The paid tiers are not settable and do not move.

To change it, use a drop-in — this script reinstalls the unit file on every run
and an edit made in there is gone at the next deploy:

  mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/nekara-engine.service.d
  printf '[Service]\nEnvironment=PUBLIC_DELAY_S=60\n' \
    > /etc/systemd/system/nekara-engine.service.d/public-delay.conf
  systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart nekara-engine

Then read back what the engine actually loaded, rather than what you set:
  journalctl -u nekara-engine -n 20 --no-pager | grep "tier latency"

Watch it:   journalctl -u nekara-engine -f
Look for:   [FIRED]  a call went on record
            [WIN]    one reached 2x
            [DEAD]   one fell to a tenth of entry

Two crons are installed for you, in /etc/cron.d/nekara:
  - every 10 minutes the watchdog checks the api, restarts the engine once if
    it is not answering, and says so on Telegram when a token is configured
  - the register is copied into /opt/nekara/backup every night at 03:00, and
    copies older than 90 days are dropped monthly

Test the watchdog now if you like:  /usr/local/bin/nekara-watchdog

# it, for the same reason the site may not print a stat it did not compute.

cat <<'NOTES2'

Two of those are worth reading again in a few hours rather than now:
  - a source only earns its key if what it finds clears the gates. curl
    localhost:8787/api/triage and compare scanned against fired per source,
    or open the Triage page. Scanned alone never says it.
  - with the on-chain gates armed, calls carry what the chain said when they
    fired. A line reading "not checked" on a call page was never established
    and is not a pass.

The mint line above is read back from the engine, not from what you set. Until
a contract is deployed it says so, and the Keys page says so too — the button
stays dead and the panel reads "0 / 666 minted", which is a fact rather than a
guess. Wiring it is KEYS_CONTRACT, BASE_RPC, KEYS_CHAIN_ID and, if there is a
whitelist, ALLOWLIST_PROOFS. See contracts/DEPLOY.md; the reveal window is the
part with a deadline.
